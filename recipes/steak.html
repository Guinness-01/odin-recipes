     <p> What makes the perfect steak? some say it's the rub, a mix of spices, the cut of steak,
         or even the sauce you put on it. SO what actully makes the perfect steak?. <br>
         In my experiance the best steak no matter the cut, sauce, or spices is prepared as follows.</p>

    <ol>
       <li>brigning the meat to room tempature</li>
       <li>Getting your cooking surpace as hot as it will go. bbq or another type of grill is preferd but pan can work too.</li>
       <li>seasoning the steak simply or to your spesific preferance, i like montreal steak spice</li>
       <li>patting the meat dry, then putting on your cooking surface.</li>
       <li>turn your steak a quarter once it easily lifts from you cooking surface then flip and repeat</li>
       <li>Once the steak has been seared on both sides bring the temp down if you desire more than medium rare 
        or you can remove it and let the steak settle on a plate for 3-5 min.</li>
        <li>and the last step.... enjoy!</li>
